# Customer Segmentation with K-Mean Model
***Context***

 Customer segmentation is a strategic process that involves categorizing a large customer base into smaller, more cohesive groups characterized by shared attributes or behaviors. This approach empowers businesses to gain deeper insights into their customers' individual requirements, preferences, and actions. Consequently, companies can customize their marketing tactics and product offerings to cater to the distinct demands of each segment. Customer segmentation plays a pivotal role in recognizing high-value customer segments, enabling precise targeting, and facilitating the delivery of personalized experiences. This, in turn, enhances overall customer satisfaction and fosters greater customer loyalty.
